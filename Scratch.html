     </p>
	 <h2> Description: </h2>
	 <p> <h3>Use Scratch to design and create a program that showes your name. Hi had to inclde th letters of your name and each one had to hav 3 unique behaviors and perform them when the green flag is clicked. For extra credit you clould have had it reset when the spacebar is pressed."</h3>
	 </p>
	 <h2> Concept Learned: </h2>
	 <ul>
	     <li> Using event blocks-green flag clicked, when key pressed </li>
		<li> Condional Statements- used if statements to start the actions of the letters when the green flag was clicked</li>
	    <li> Used loops- I used a repeat x times to make the letters spin a certain amount</li>
		<li> Sprites- I used sprites from the Scratch library to create a name</li>
		<li> Movement- I used movement statements to move the y position of my letters</li>
		     </ul>
		<h2> Computer Buying Project </h2>
		<p>
		     <img src="images/Computer Buying Project Picture.jpg"/ Width="400" Height="300">
	    </p>
		     <h2> Description: </h2>
			 <p> <h3>Research different computers and choose the best one in order to learn the different components that make a good computer. This included reaserching what the various parts of a computer are, and what they do within the computer. It also involved us asking peopl we know questions about what they would want in a computer in layman's terms</h3> </p>
			 <p> <h2> Concepts Learned: </h2> </p>
			 <p> <li> CPU- I learned what a Central Processing Unit is, and how it affects the memory and processing speed of a computer </li>
			     <li> RAM- I learned that the RAM is the short term memory of a computer </li>
				 <li> Hard Drive- I learned that the Hard Drive is what holds the long term memory of the computer </li>
				 <li> Optical Drive- The Optical Drive is things like a DVD player that allows you to view content from other media sources </li>
				 <li> Speakers- Speakers allow the computer to produce its  own soumds </li>
				 <li> Video Card- Controls the quality of the images that a computer monitor can produce </li>
				 <li> Say Blocks- Learned how to use say blocks with an event in order to make sprites say something in text </li>
				 <li> Show Blocks- Learnded how to use and incorporate the ability to show and hide sprited a the press of a button </li>
				 <li> Making Sprites- I learned how to create new sprites both from editing pictures from the internet, and creating brand new sprites from the text and picture makaers </li>
				 
				 <p> <h2> Final Project </h2> </p>
				 <p> <img src="images/Amon's Flight Picture.jpg"/ Width="400" Height="300"> </p>
				 <p>
				 <h2> Description: </h2>
				 </p>
				 <p> Use what you have learned in scratch to create a video game that incorporates a score, timer, and has at least 3 levels. It involves the character Amon as he flies through the sky avoiding objects. It was a fin way to bring everything that we have learned about scratch together </p>
				 <p>
                 <h2> Concepts Learned: </h2>
				 </p>
				 <p>
				 <li> I learned how to incorporate moving objects and a timer into a program </li>
				 <li> I learned about timers and how to use them to keep score </li>
