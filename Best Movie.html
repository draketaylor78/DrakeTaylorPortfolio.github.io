<p> <h1> Why I like the movie </h1> </p>
<p> <h2> This is my favorite movie because it is a fantastic tale of heroes on the run, epic battles, trust and betrayal, a student learning to be a master, and one of the greatest twists in cinamatic history. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time wondering if your favorite characters will survive to the end. It is also a special effects wonder, using models and camera angles to make starfighters and giant walker come to life, and still surpasses any CGI effects done today. </h2> </p>
<p> <h1> My Favorite Actor </h1> </p>
<p> <h2> My favorite actor is Danny Bullock. Few know his name but everybody knows his character, Boba Fett. This bounty hunter has a haunting precence throught the movie and is a terrifying figure despite only having a few lines; the most memerable being "He's no good to me dead".
